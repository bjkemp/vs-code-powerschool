# TLIST_SQL Syntax Highlighting Extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides syntax highlighting and a snippet for TList SQL statements in Visual Studio Code. The author is not affiliated with PowerSchool.

## Features

The extension adds syntax highlighting for TLIST_SQL statements enclosed in `~[tlist_sql; ... ]` and `[/tlist_sql]` tags. The SQL statements are highlighted using the same syntax highlighting rules as the built-in SQL language support.

## Known Issues

* This extension does not overwrite javascript linting errors in the SQL statements. This is a limitation of the Visual Studio Code API that I hope to address in a future release.

### 0.0.1

* Initial release of the TList SQL Syntax Highlighting Extension for Visual Studio Code.
